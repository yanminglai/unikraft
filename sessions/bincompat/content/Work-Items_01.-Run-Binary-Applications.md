We want to test the `run-app-elfloader/` setup together with applications in `static-pie-apps/` repository.

Run as many executables as possible from the `static-pie-apps/` repository.

See the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/unikraft/run-app-elfloader/blob/master/README.md) and run `redis-server` and `sqlite3` static PIE executables.
