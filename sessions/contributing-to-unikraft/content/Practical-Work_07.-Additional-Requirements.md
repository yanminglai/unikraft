Check the [original library's `README`](https://github.com/jtsiomb/kdtree#readme) to see if it needs to be configured first, and add the proper rule if so.

**Note**: Make sure to also check the library `Config.uk` file for aditional dependencies.

**Hint**: As in most ported libraries, a configuration step is required and it consists in simply running a script.
